https://dhvl15.shinyapps.io/project1/


**What is the problem?**

In today’s world, people migrate from one place to the other for growth and development. The most common purpose of migration is a money hike. According to statistics, not every person who migrates has profited. When people leave their homeland they feel stuck, lonely, and depressed, and face problems such as lack of opportunities, coping with a different common language, homesickness, lack of family support, and cultural differences in the migrated country. All these problems lead to underperformance in their career and ultimately not completing their goal of a money hike. People are always concerned if their decision of migration would be profitable or not.

**Why is it worth furthur research?**

It is necessary to solve this issue, because it decides the career of a person. The future of a person totally depends on the target country the person is migrating into. Companies in the target country can use the model to analyse people coming from the base country. The analysis can also be used to examine the economy of countries.

Our project has developed an Rshiny app to visualize the base country’s and target country’s advantages based on country, industry and skill migrations. The prospective migrant can choose base country and their target country with the preferred industry/ skill to check if their would be growth or downfall. We have also developed a regression model based on Random Forest to predict absolute net flow of money for the year 2023. This will also help people to understand the growth in the future.
